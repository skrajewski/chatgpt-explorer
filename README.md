## üéØ Purpose

**Privacy-focused exploration of your ChatGPT conversations.** This tool solves the problem of ChatGPT's export format being difficult to navigate and search. Instead of manually parsing JSON files, you get:

- **Intuitive Interface** - Chat-like conversation view similar to ChatGPT
- **Powerful Search** - Real-time search across all your conversations
- **Complete Privacy** - All data processing happens locally in your browser
- **Media Support** - View images, play audio, and access attachments
- **Offline Access** - Works without an internet connection once loaded

## üóÇÔ∏è How to Get Your ChatGPT Data

Before using this tool, you need to export your ChatGPT conversation history from OpenAI:

### Step 1: Request Your Data Export

1. Visit [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on your profile icon in the bottom-left corner
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Data controls**
4. Click **"Export data"**
5. Confirm your request via email

### Step 2: Download Your Export

- OpenAI will email you when your export is ready (usually within 24 hours)
- Download the ZIP file from the link in the email

### What's Included in Your Export

Your ZIP file contains:

- `conversations.json` - All your conversation data
- `file-*` pattern images (screenshots, uploads)
- `dalle-generations/` - AI-generated images from DALL-E
- `audio/` folders - Voice conversation recordings
- `user-*/` directories - Files you uploaded to ChatGPT

## üîÑ How It Works

The ChatGPT Explorer processes your data through these steps:

### 1. **Secure Upload**

Drop your ChatGPT export ZIP file into the browser. No data leaves your device.

### 2. **Client-Side Processing**

- Unzips and parses your `conversations.json` file
- Reconstructs conversation threads from ChatGPT's mapping structure
- Extracts and links media files (images, audio, documents)
- Builds a searchable index of all message content

### 3. **Interactive Exploration**

- Browse conversations in a familiar chat interface
- Search across all conversations with real-time highlighting
- View images and play audio files inline
- Access conversation metadata and timestamps

### 4. **Offline Operation**

Once loaded, the app works completely offline thanks to PWA caching.
